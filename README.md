ApprovalTests.PHP
=================
Capturing Human Intelligence - ApprovalTests is an open source assertion/verification library to aid unit testing.

It is compatible with PHPUnit

What can it be used for?
---

Approval Tests can be used for verifying objects that require more than a simple assert. They also come prepackaged with utilities for some common scenarios including

- HashMaps & Collections
- Long Strings
- Log Files
- Xml
- Html
- Json (see [features](docs/features.md))

How to get it
---
It's on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/approvals/approval-tests);
search for 'approval-tests'. If you're using Composer, you can add it as follows:

```sh
composer req --dev approvals/approval-tests
```

---

You can watch a bunch of short videos on getting started and [using ApprovalTests](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFBA98F47156EFAA9&feature=view_all) at YouTube.
These cover approval tests in Java and .NET, but the same concepts apply.

Examples
---
ApprovalTests eats it own dogfood, so the best examples are in the source code itself.

None the less,  Here's a quick look at some
[Sample Code](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.php/blob/9ce5bbd043ea2720bdfe5bbdf25f23a225329485/tests/ApprovalTest.php#L8)

<!-- snippet: array_example -->
<a id='snippet-array_example'></a>
```php
class ApprovalTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testVerifyArray()
    {
        $list = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'];
        Approvals::verifyList($list);
    }
```
<sup><a href='/tests/ApprovalTest.php#L8-L16' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-array_example' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Will Produce a File

<!-- snippet: tests/approvals/ApprovalTest.testVerifyArray.approved.txt -->
<a id='snippet-tests/approvals/ApprovalTest.testVerifyArray.approved.txt'></a>
```txt
[0] -> zero
[1] -> one
[2] -> two
[3] -> three
[4] -> four
[5] -> five
```
<sup><a href='/tests/approvals/ApprovalTest.testVerifyArray.approved.txt#L1-L6' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-tests/approvals/ApprovalTest.testVerifyArray.approved.txt' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

Simply rename this to ApprovalTest.testVerifyArray.approved.txt and the test will now pass.

Approved File Artifacts
---

The `*.approved.*` files must be checked into source your source control.
This can be an issue with git as it will change the line endings.
The suggested fix is to add
`*.approved.* binary` to your `.gitattributes`
